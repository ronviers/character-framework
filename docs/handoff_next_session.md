# Character — next-session handoff

State pointer. Thin by design: committed detail lives in `character_receipts.md` / `character_frontier.md` /
`character.md` / git — this file holds **current state + open threads** only. All work below is committed + pushed.

## Where things stand

**Latest (this session): gMAM built + adjudicated — `current-aids-escape` KILLED as a barrier effect,
metabolized as the transverse-decomposition theorem.** The arc:
- **gMAM minimizer implemented + validated** (Maier–Stein gate: gradient action `0.5000` to 0.01%, and the
  `β>β_c` instanton correctly bows off-axis — `gmam_maier_stein.py`).
- **Homochiral: the σ→0 quasipotential is FLAT in the current** — `ΔŜ_H≈0` over `𝒜:0→21.8`
  (`Ŝ=0.382→0.380`, vs the finite-σ slope's `−17%`), robust across seed/momentum/eps/both-groups; the
  instanton never bends off the symmetric subspace (`gmam_current_aids.py`, `gmam_affinity_scaling.py`).
  Autocat A: the consistent null. So the committed finite-σ `ΔV` drop (`0.328→0.272`) is the **irreversible
  Eyring–Kramers PREFACTOR**, not the FW barrier (`ΔV_eff = ΔV_true + σ²·logK(𝒜)`).
- **Why (symmetry):** the current is *exactly transverse* to the escape mode at the saddle
  (`|cos(J,e_u)|~1e-15`; escape = 100% the between-group breaking mode, current = within-group 3-cycle),
  **symmetry-protected** — exact across a saddle-moving μ-sweep (`gmam_orthogonality_sweep.py`), broken `∝δ`
  by a within-group Z₃ break (`gmam_symmetry_break_probe.py`). Barred from `ΔV` by the
  **transverse-decomposition theorem** (Graham–Haken; FW §4.3; Bouchet–Reygner). 3 outside reports unanimous
  (`docs/research_prompt_current_aids_escape_prefactor_theorem.md`).
- **Selection rule confirmed in-substrate:** mixing the irreps with that same δ turns the barrier effect ON
  (`ΔŜ_H: 0→0.33` as `e_u·cyclic→0.64` — the Maier–Stein bow-out, `gmam_mixing_test.py`).
- **LANDED in canon:** `pa:transverse-decomposition` (new prior-art); receipts §Branch-survival barrier
  (reversed reading); frontier §Tombstones `current-aids-escape`; `character.md` §Two tangent sectors (the
  large-deviation face of the DFS) + §The two-survivals plane (`ΔV⊥𝒜` by symmetry). Broader implication —
  the metric⊥topological orthogonality, asserted in five dialects across `character.md`, is **one mechanism**
  (Schur → transverse decomposition; protected current barred from the metric sector's barriers, confined to
  their prefactors). **► Next: Tier-2 Hamiltonian sgMAM** (no ε) to confirm invariance at extreme exclusion
  (μ≈3, past the Tier-1 ε-floor where ΔŜ scatters); the surface-code reading (same orthogonality) is asserted
  not computed. See Open threads #1–#2.

The two-survivals plane is fully instanced (all four corners), and **`both` (`ΔV>0 ∧ 𝒜≠0`) is now reached two
ways on each of two independence axes** — *symmetry* and *bifurcation mechanism*:

- **`both` via exchange-SSB** — the co-handed twin-cycle (`twin_cycle_corner.py`): `𝒜≈21.8`, `ΔV≈0.018`;
  sign(`𝒜`) *preserved* across the branch flip where parity *reverses* it (the orthogonality made visible a
  way parity can't). The competitive-exclusion mechanism is **handedness-blind** (`twin_mu_sweep.py`,
  `max|Δa|≈2.4e-11`; same `μ_c=0.833`, same linear `ΔV`).
- **`both` via soft pitchfork** — the autocatalytic (Kondepudi–Nelson) substrate (`autocat_pitchfork.py`
  current-free; `autocat_both.py` with current): `ee*²` linear, `ΔU∝ee*⁴` **quadratic** (vs the twin's
  hard/linear), coexistence window `ec∈[0.05,0.20]`. **Calibrated claim (channel, honest):** symmetry breaking
  does NOT fix the barrier scaling — the *saturation mechanism* does. NOT "mechanism-independent" (owed: a
  clean normal-form reduction + >2 instances). Core sentence committed (`character.md` §The two-survivals plane).
- **Competitive-exclusion review metabolized** (`docs/review_prompt_competitive_exclusion.md`): the L↔R
  transition is a **symmetric transcritical** (boundary branches, exchange of stability), not a pitchfork; no
  bare-LV regime gives a soft pitchfork. Folded into receipts §Branch-survival barrier.
- **Nudge track** (`character_frontier.md` §Nudges) — a parallel *doc-gate* track for steering candidates;
  first entry `nudge:loaded-endpoint-descent` (from the sleep lay-question). **Policy: HELD** — accumulate the
  corpus, read the shapes, promote nothing to core yet (even the mature-looking
  *apparent-structure ≠ protected-observable* shape).
- **β-collapse 3rd register — CLOSED (theory-first).** Three channel derivations
  (`docs/research_prompt_beta_r3_derivation.md`) unanimously reject `α_s=β` on the linear-Gaussian confined
  fractional process — structurally: the FDR is an *amplitude ratio*, so `β` cancels; only the nonlinear
  response sector could supply it. Parked as a clean negative result. The **2-register collapse** (R1
  covariance + R2 Norros queue, `beta_collapse.py`) is the banked-strong over-determination. Record:
  `docs/beta_collapse_3rd_register_design.md`.

## Open threads (ranked; none blocking)

1. **Tier-2 Hamiltonian sgMAM — confirm barrier-invariance at extreme exclusion (μ≈3).** The Tier-1
   ε-regularized gMAM converges cleanly at the operating point (μ=1.6) and the interior end (μ=1.0: `ΔŜ=0`
   eps-stable), but at strong exclusion (μ=3.0, attractor jammed on the orthant boundary) it hits its noise
   floor — `ΔŜ` scatters `±0.09` and flips sign in both nit and eps (`gmam_orthogonality_sweep.py` extremes).
   The saddle orthogonality there is still machine-exact (symmetry-protected), so the symmetry argument
   *predicts* invariance; the Hamiltonian sgMAM (Grafke–Schäfer–Vanden-Eijnden, first-derivative-only, no ε
   — momentum stays finite as `xᵢ→0`) is the right tool to verify it without the boundary blowup. Plan §3
   Tier-2 + §8. Low urgency (the verdict doesn't hinge on it; this closes the one boundary-limited corner).
2. **The surface-code reading (same orthogonality, not yet computed).** `pa:transverse-decomposition` and the
   §Two-tangent-sectors note assert that the protected logical sector is barred from the syndrome-sector's
   error dynamics by the *same* irrep-orthogonality (the DFS = the transverse decomposition). The distance-3
   surface-code substrate is checked at the point/space layer but the barrier-invariance reading is asserted,
   not measured. Owed: read the QEC instance through the transverse-decomposition lens (a unification across
   the three checked substrates), or down-rank the claim to "by analogy."
3. **β-collapse R3 sum-rule check** *(low priority)* — model c's `α_s+β=1` vs a/b's no-exponent; the vary-`k`
   probe repurposed (confined fLE + CK estimator). A *side* finding (complementarity relation), **not** the
   collapse. Or close R3 clean. My lean: let it rest unless the sum rule itself interests.
4. **autocat-`both` noisy barrier** — *attempted (probes), returned a null* (folded into #1). The
   `a=b` vs `a≠b` `ΔV(𝒜)` comparison on the soft-pitchfork `both` showed **no current effect** on escape
   (flip counts identical within Poisson, `𝒜:0→2.3`). Diagnostics: the activated σ-window is brutally
   narrow (0 flips → saturated over a thin band), current intrinsically weak (the weak cycle that makes it
   a soft pitchfork makes its current weak), branches interior (`m*=0.71`). Not worth a committed
   experiment file as-is; revisit only if the outbound report (#1) suggests a deeper-branch / different
   operating point worth measuring.
5. **Nudge corpus** — HELD. Next loaded-endpoint / steering-miss → log as a nudge (or add a trigger to an
   existing one); promote nothing. Watch whether they cluster in the apparent-structure≠protected shape.
